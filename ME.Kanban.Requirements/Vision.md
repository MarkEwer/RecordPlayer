# Kanban System Vision

This product is a kanban work management system. Kanban is a Japanese word that means "signal card" and the use of a "card" is a central metaphor throughout the system. The concept is fairly simple; we put up a "board" that has columns for each step in the overall workflow needed to complete the tasks in a project. Then, we create a "card" and place it on the board in the column that represents the current state of that card's associated work. As work is completed, the cards are moved to different columns until they are eventually complete. By convention, the first column that indicates new work to be accomplished is on the far left, and the column that indicates the work is complete is on the far right with the steps in between arranged in roughly chronological order. This means that if you step back and look at the board as a whole you can see a rough picture of the overall state of the project team at that moment.

## Problem Statement

Managing a project can be time consuming and very difficult to communicate to project team members and stakeholders. The use of charts, work breakdowns, and management plans do not sufficiently provide an "at a glance" view of the project status nor do they serve as acceptable information radiators.

When a kanban board is placed in an easily accessible and often accessed area then it provides a quick overview of a project's work status and communicates this effectively to the entire team. Additionally, it helps team members quickly find the work they need to perform next and show managers where the bottlenecks are in the production process.

## Product Features

1. A customizable kanban board that show the current project status.
2. A card on the kanban board for each work product that needs to be processed.
3. A column on the board for each step in the work process of the project.
4. A column can be sub-divided into rows to indicate parallel process steps.
5. Each column has a defined maximum capacity to limit the work in progress at that step and identify bottlenecks.
6. Managers can define and change the board columns and associated work process.
7. Workers can find the work tasks they need to perform next by looking in the columns assigned to them.
8. Reviewers can find the work products they need to inspect by looking in the columns assigned to them.
9. Details of how to complete a task, what work products are involved in the task, and the history of what has already been done for the task are all tracked inside the details of the card.
