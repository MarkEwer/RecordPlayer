# Reviewer

Reviewers are team members that verify the correctness and/or completeness of work products at one or more steps in the product workflow. This can take the form of a Quality Assurance role or a work approver of some kind.

## Initial Use Cases

### Approve or Reject a Work Task

1. Quickly identify the work cards that are waiting for my review.
2. View the details of a card's work requirements and the work products created during the work execution to verify if the requirements have been met and the result meets my quality expectations.
3. Comment on a work card so the worker assigned to this card will receive the message.
4. Reject a work card so that it returns to the awaiting queue in the current project board column.
5. Approve a work card and specify which column it should move to next based on the workflow rules for the project board.
