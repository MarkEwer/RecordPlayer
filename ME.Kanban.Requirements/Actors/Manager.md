# Manager

In our kanban system, the manager is responsible for creating the structure of the overall kanban board and setting up the workflow used to resolve the cards on the board. This means the manager will create the initial project and define the project boards that will be part of the project. Then, the manager will specify all the workflow rules needed to move the work cards across the board(s) to completion.
